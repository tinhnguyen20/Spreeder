The main objective is to help people of all ages read faster and more easily with increased comprehension and retention. Described is a chunking algorithm which can divide a given text into natural chunks, taking into account the syntax and semantics of the English language as well as the peripheral field of view of the human eye. To be done next is highlighting these chunks inside web browser and e-book, and making this tool available to all. By allowing the computer to guide the readerâ€™s eyes, over time, the reader will be able to chunk material similarly, and have better reading comprehension at a faster speed.
